      subtitle: Feature
      description: When you receive an SMS from an unknown contact, ScamShield will
        determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm, and filter
        the messages to a junk SMS folder. Scam SMSes will be sent to NCPC and
        SPF for collation. This keeps the app updated and will help protect
        others from such scam calls and messages.
