### What is ScamShield?
ScamShield is an anti-scam product developed by the National Crime Prevention Council and Open Government Products. 

### Features

The ScamShield mobile app has 3 main features: 
* Automatically blocks scam calls
* Automatically detects scam messages 
* Allows users to report scam messages and calls

### How it works

The ScamShield app detects incoming scam calls and text messages. Incoming calls from unknown numbers are checked against a database maintained by the Singapore Police Force – if ScamShield determines the number has been used for scams, it'll be blocked.

For incoming SMSes from anyone who isn't a saved contact, ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. For the iOS version, it filters these scam SMSes into the Junk folder. For Android, a notification is sent to alert users that they may have received a scam message.

Detected and reported scam messages and calls are sent to NCPC and SPF for collation. This keeps the app updated and will help protect others from such scam calls and messages. 

**ScamShield does not collect any personal information from the user.**
