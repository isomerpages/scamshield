### New Reporting Channels 

To enable easy reporting and checking of messages, ScamShield is developing a bot on  WhatsApp. Users can easily forward scam messages or screenshots and check if a message is believed to be a scam or not. These messages can also be reported to the relevant authorities via the bot. Users will be able to add ScamShield Bot as a Whatsapp contact via a unique short link or QR code.

The ScamShield bot is expected to be launched later this year.
