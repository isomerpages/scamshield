### Will the app block calls from people I know?

No. The app only blocks calls from our database of blocked numbers, managed centrally by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).

### Will it filter SMSes from people I know?

The app does filter messages coming from people in your contact list or contacts that you have an existing conversation with.

### Will I still be able to see the SMSes that have been filtered?

Yes. A junk SMS folder will be created on your phone. It is the same concept as a junk folder for your email inbox. You will still be able to see those messages.

### Are there any privacy concerns with using the app?

Nope, iOS has strict privacy rules on what ScamShield can or cannot read. If a message comes from a known contact, iOS will not pass the SMS to Scamshield. If you have previously interacted with an unknown contact or decided to engage an unknown contact in conversation then ScamShield will not get to see the message either. Only messages sent by unknown persons via SMS will be read by the AI. The app also does not have any access to your location data or any personal data (because it&#39;s not necessary!)

### What happens if I delete the app? Will all my junk messages be deleted too?

No, the app does not delete your messages. If you delete the app, the junk SMS folder on your phone will remain with all the SMSes intact.

### When will the Android version be out? I want this app on my phone!

We are working with our partners to roll out an Android version. We will let you know as soon as it is ready.

### Who built this app?

The app is a collaboration between the NCPC, Open Government Products team (OGP) at the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and SPF.

### Once installed, can hackers hack into my phone if the app is compromised?

As the app does not individually identify any users, and it does not access any other data on your phone, you and your phone are not at risk if the app is compromised.

### How does ScamShield work?

The app filters incoming calls and text messages. ScamShield compares an incoming call against a list maintained by the Singapore Police Force to determine if the number has been used for illegal purposes and blocks it. 

When you receive an incoming SMS from an unknown contact,  ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm and filters the messages to a junk SMS folder.

Scam SMSes will be sent to NCPC and SPF for collation. This keeps the app updated and will help protect others from such scam calls and messages.

### Why should I download ScamShield?

Currently, telcos do not help you filter scam and spam calls and text messages. 

ScamShield mobile app is free to download and most importantly, it may prevent scammers from contacting you. 

### How do I set up the app for the first time?

You can find our app in the Apple App Store if you search for "ScamShield" or click on this [link](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/scamshield/id1497144087). You can refer to our Setup page for more installation instructions

### Do I need a Wi-Fi or data plan for the app to work?

No, you donâ€™t need Wi-Fi or data plan for the app to work. The app will run on the background to filter incoming calls and text messages. 

However, without Wi-Fi or data plan, the app will be unable to send details of the scam messages and numbers for collation.

### Will the app be able to filter spam messages from WhatsApp?

No, the app can only filter incoming SMSes. If you received spam messages from other chat apps such as WhatsApp, Wechat, IMO, Viber, etc, you can forward the spam messages via in-app reporting function. Alternatively, you can forward the spam messages to +65-8241 0342. Standard text messages apply for each SMS.

### Can I inactivate either the filtering of incoming phone calls or text messages function?

Yes, either function can be deactivated at any time in your settings. To learn more visit our [setup guide](https://www.scamshield.sg/setup-guide/)
