#### ScamShield Privacy Safeguards
ScamShield is an application that works actively in the background to  **facilitate the detection, reporting and blocking of potential scam calls, as well as messages from unknown numbers not in your contact list.** 

The application does **not** have access to your contact list or any private data found therein. ScamShield cannot access the contents of SMSes already in your inbox, and it cannot access your call log.

We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and we only store the data necessary for the app to function. Further, we align ourselves with the strict privacy parameters set by Apple and iOS, and we follow the commercial best practices of data protection and data governance.

For full transparency, the only data we store is:
1. Contents of messages that are flagged up by ScamShield as &#39;scam&#39; messages;
2. The sender ID and/or contact number(s) of the person who sends such &#39;scam&#39; messages

We do not store any other data and there are no identifiers to trace back to any individual users. For the avoidance of doubt, only SMSes that the ScamShield application determines to be scam are automatically reported and sent to NCPC, and ScamShield does not have the capability to read **any** other messages on your phone.

If you feel that your number might have been blocked as a scam number by ScamShield, you may write in to [scamshield@ncpc.org.sg](mailto:scamshield@ncpc.org.sg).

This is subject to the conclusion of investigation, if any, by the Singapore Police Force regarding your number.

#### We use anonymised data to improve ScamShield
ScamShield collects anonymised data about your device and app (e.g. device model, app version) to help us improve the app and provide a better user experience.

#### Tailoring Your Experience
Users may, at their full discretion, turn off any or all of the features of Scamshield on their devices. By going to the device settings, you can turn off the automatic filtering and reporting of scam messages, the automatic blocking of calls from scam numbers, and you can even turn off push notifications on the latest scam typologies. By doing so, you acknowledge that your user experience may be affected and the application may not function as intended.

#### Reporting unknown numbers via ScamShield
Users can report unknown or unsolicited numbers through ScamShield by providing the source number and text message.
