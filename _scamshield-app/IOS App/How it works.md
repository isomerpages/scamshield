### Set up Scamshield iOS to block scam calls and SMSes

---

#### How can I tell if ScamShield is working on my iOS phone?

<img style="width:90%" alt="<An SMS that is filtered by ScamShield>" src="/images/ios%20filter.png">


*   When you receive a scam SMS from an **unknown number** that is determined to be a scam, ScamShield filters the messages to a junk SMS folder.
*   You’ll be able to view messages filtered by ScamShield by going into your Junk Messages and seeing the label **‘Filtered by ScamShield’**.
*   By default, messages in the Junk folder are deleted after 30 days.
*   ScamShield also works in the background silently to block scam calls.
*   You don't need to report scam messages that have already been filtered by ScamShield.

#### What should I report to ScamShield?

*   To help us protect you better, report any scams that we may have missed filtering. 

#### How does it work on my iOS phone?

*   The app filters incoming calls and SMSes from **unknown numbers, including overseas numbers**. ScamShield uses a combination of an on-device algorithm and information provided by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), such as blacklisted numbers linked to scams, to determine if a call or SMS is a scam.
*   When you receive an SMS from an unknown number, ScamShield will determine if the SMS is a scam using an on-device algorithm. 
*   For iOS, it filters the messages to a junk SMS folder.



#### Your privacy is important to us

*   For your privacy, ScamShield **does not filter calls and SMSes from contacts that you have saved on your phone.**
